# Kaggle Data Engineering 

## 'Your model is the engine, but clean data is the fuel.'

I am sharing the following courses which have aided me in consolidating my domain knowledge. It has been especially useful in helping me create clean data which maximises machine learning (ML) performance. A real highlight was culmination of Kaggle House Prices ML competition, and the inclusion of powerful K-Means and PCA techniques in the course.
